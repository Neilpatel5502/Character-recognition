# Character-recognition
In this machine learning project, we will recognize handwritten characters, i.e, English alphabets from A-Z. I used tensorflow and keras for better model building. With the help of CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) we will predict the charcter in this project. Dataset link--> https://www.kaggle.com/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format
